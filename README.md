# Medium Clone
## Overview

This project is a demonstration of a platform inspired by Medium (all rights reserved to them). It serves as a forum-like application built with modern web technologies. The goal of the app is to showcase advanced architectural techniques, particularly the use of a ZoneLess approach, instead of the typical zone.js, making the application more efficient and performant.

## You can view the live demo of the app [here](https://lautarobernati.github.io/medium-clone).

## Key Features
### ZoneLess Architecture: This application is built without the use of zone.js, demonstrating a more efficient approach to change detection in Angular.
### Real-Time Interaction: Built on the foundations of modern frontend frameworks to allow a dynamic, real-time experience.
### Forum-like Platform: A place for users to read and share articles, similar to Medium's core functionality.

## Technologies Used
### Angular 15: The core framework for building dynamic web applications.
### Angular Universal and SSG (to be able to bypass hash strategy).
### NgRx 15: For state management using Redux principles in Angular.
### RxJS 7: Reactive programming library for handling asynchronous data streams.
### Bootstrap 5: A popular framework for responsive design and UI components.
### ESLint: For code linting to ensure code quality and consistency.
### Github Pages for hosting.

## Backend Integration
This application integrates with the Real World API provided by gothinkster's [RealWorld Project APIs](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld/) to manage and retrieve data.

Demonstration Purpose
Please note that this project is intended solely for demonstration purposes. It is a learning project and may not represent a fully production-ready application.
